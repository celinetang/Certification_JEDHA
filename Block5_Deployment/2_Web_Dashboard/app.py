When using Getaround, drivers book cars for a specific time period, from an hour to a few days long. They are supposed to bring back the car on time, but it happens from time to time that drivers are late for the checkout.

Late returns at checkout can generate high friction for the next driver if the car was supposed to be rented again on the same day : Customer service often reports users unsatisfied because they had to wait for the car to come back from the previous rental or users that even had to cancel their rental because the car wasnt returned on time.""")

        In order to mitigate those issues we‚Äôve decided to implement a minimum delay between two rentals. A car won‚Äôt be displayed in the search results if the requested checkin or checkout times are too close from an already booked rental.

        It solves the late checkout issue but also potentially hurts Getaround/owners revenues: we need to find the right trade off.
        
        - First, a delay analysis is conducted on the dataset that is provided, in order to determine a threshold duration between checkout and checkin of next rental.
        - Second, you can find a price predictor for rental cars. """)
