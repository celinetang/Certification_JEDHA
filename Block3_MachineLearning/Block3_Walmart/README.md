# Block 3 - Supervised Machine Learning : Walmart weekly sales prediction

This project is submitted for the Jedha Data Fullstack program certification. 


## Deliverables

- Video Presentation :
- Jupyter notebook with EDA, preprocessing, baseline model, and regularized models by Lasso and Ridge to avoid overfitting. 


## Project Overview

The project consists in building a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in Walmart stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. 

## Objective

- Part 1 : EDA and all necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning
- Part 2 : Training of baseline model : linear regression 
- Part 3 : Avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model

### Dataset

The dataset has been taken from a Kaggle competition, but with changes made by Jedha. It can be found in this folder (Walmart_Store_sales.csv)
It contains information about weekly sales achieved by different Walmart stores, and other variable such as the unemployment rate, fuel price and others.
