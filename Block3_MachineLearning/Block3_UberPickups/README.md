# Block 3 - Unsupervised Machine Learning : Uber

This project is submitted for the Jedha Data Fullstack program certification. 


## Deliverables

- Video Presentation : https://share.vidyard.com/watch/d5WCzD68JJMvgbz41oz6RT?
- Jupyter notebook with two unsupervised clustering algorithms : KMeans and DBScan
- 2 HTML pages containing maps for each day of the week with animation on timeframe (Daytime, Rush Hour, Evening and Night) 


## Project Overview

In order to **advise Uber drivers on where to be at which time**, the goal of this project is to **identify "hot-zones" from Uber pick-up requests data**, and display theses zones on a map.

## Objective

- Part 1 : EDA
- Part 2 : KMeans clustering
- Part 3 : DBScan clustering

### Dataset

The dataset is not included in the Git repo as it is too heavy to be uploaded. It can be found at [here](https://full-stack-bigdata-datasets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Machine+Learning+non+Supervis%C3%A9/Projects/uber-trip-data.zip)
