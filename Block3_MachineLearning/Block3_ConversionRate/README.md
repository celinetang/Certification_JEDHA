# Block 3 - Supervised Machine Learning : Conversion rate Challenge

This project is submitted for the Jedha Data Fullstack program certification. It was programmed during the bootcamp as a machine learning competition.


## Deliverables

- Video Presentation : https://share.vidyard.com/watch/LQK2GRY7dnuHeSXngFGS3z?
- Jupyter notebook including EDA, baseline model training + one other model training
- leaderboard with scores
- excel file that enabled a follow-up of the different models trained


## Project Overview

The project consists in predicting the conversion rate (when a user subscribes to a newsletter) of datascienceweekly.org, by using just a few information about the user.

## Objective

- Part 1 : EDA
- Part 2 : Training of baseline model
- Part 3 : Improve f1-score on train set
- Part 4 : Make predictions with test set 

### Dataset

The dataset is separated into 2 files in the data folder :
- conversion_data_train.csv : it contains the labelled data, used to train a model
- conversion_data_test.csv : without any labels, used to make some predictions to be sent to competition
