# Block 4 - Deep Learning : AT&T Spam detector

This project is submitted for the Jedha Data Fullstack program certification.

## Deliverables

- Video Presentation :
- Jupyter notebook with EDA, preprocessing, model and prediction analysis


## Project Overview

The project consists in building a deep learning model that will be able to flag down spam messages in an automated way. The client is AT&T, a telecommunication company based in the US. 

## Objective

- Part 1 : EDA and all necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning
- Part 2 : Build a spam detector that can automatically detect spams via a sophisticated model 

### Dataset

The dataset has been taken from a Kaggle competition, but with changes made by Jedha. It can be found in this folder (spam.csv)
Each row corresponds to a message, along with a classification if it is spam or not. 

### Prerequisites 
This jupyter notebook was written and executed in a Google Colab notebook so as to use tensorflow with a GPU provided by them.
